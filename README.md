# hello-world
What do you mean? Y'all told me I should do this?!?

Well I'm pretty darn good at ~~being me~~. Not so great at being **anybody else** but like most that doesn't stop me from _trying_.

I'm a technical product manager for a small company that makes a decent integration product. I realize that small and integration don't go well together but we're kind of pulling it off.

That's it for now.
